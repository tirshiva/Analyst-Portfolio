      {
        title: "Classes and Objects",
        description: "Classes are blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of classes. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Understanding this relationship is fundamental to OOP."
      },
      {
        title: "Encapsulation",
        description: "Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit. It helps in hiding internal implementation details and protecting data from unauthorized access."
      },
      {
        title: "Inheritance",
        description: "Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes. Understanding inheritance hierarchies is crucial."
      },
      {
        title: "Polymorphism",
        description: "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code design."
      },
      {
        title: "Abstraction",
        description: "Abstraction focuses on essential features while hiding implementation details. It helps in managing complexity and creating more maintainable code."
      },
      {
        title: "Interfaces",
        description: "Interfaces define contracts that classes must follow. They enable loose coupling and provide a way to achieve abstraction in object-oriented design."

        title: "Creating Classes",

        title: "Implementing Inheritance",
        description: "Create class hierarchies using inheritance. Override methods and use super() calls. Understand method resolution order."

        description: "Use access modifiers to control data access. Implement getters and setters. Practice proper encapsulation techniques."

        title: "Class Design",
        description: "Design classes with clear responsibilities. Keep classes focused and cohesive. Avoid god classes and tight coupling."
      },
      {
        title: "Inheritance Usage",
        description: "Use inheritance for 'is-a' relationships. Prefer composition over inheritance when possible. Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow."

        title: "Interface Design",
        description: "Design interfaces that are focused and cohesive. Follow interface segregation principle. Use interfaces for abstraction."

    commonPitfalls: [
      {
        title: "Inheritance Misuse",
        description: "Using inheritance for code reuse without proper 'is-a' relationship. This can lead to fragile and hard-to-maintain code."
      },
      {
        title: "Tight Coupling",
        description: "Creating tightly coupled classes that are hard to modify and test. Always aim for loose coupling through proper abstraction."

        title: "Poor Encapsulation",
        description: "Exposing internal implementation details. Always encapsulate data and provide controlled access through methods."

        title: "Interface Bloat",
        description: "Creating interfaces that are too large or have too many responsibilities. Keep interfaces focused and cohesive."

        description: "Creating abstractions that don't match the problem domain. Ensure abstractions are meaningful and useful."

    professionalExplanation: "Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that organizes code into objects that contain data and code. It provides a way to structure and organize code that makes it more maintainable, reusable, and scalable. The principles of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction) help in creating robust and flexible software systems. Understanding these principles is crucial for designing and implementing complex software systems. Focus on applying these principles in a way that makes your code more maintainable and easier to understand."
